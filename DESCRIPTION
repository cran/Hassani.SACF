Description: The Ljung-Box test is one of the most important tests for time series diagnostics and model selection. 
    The  Hassani SACF (Sum of the Sample Autocorrelation Function) Theorem , however, indicates that the sum of sample autocorrelation function is always fix for 
    any stationary time series with arbitrary length. This package confirms for sensitivity of the Ljung-Box test to 
    the number of lags involved in the test and therefore it should be used with extra caution.
    The Hassani SACF Theorem has been described in : Hassani, Yeganegi and M. R. (2019) <doi:10.1016/j.physa.2018.12.028>.
